**[Netzo](https://app.netzo.io) is a code-first integration platform that
empowers developers to integrate APIs, code automations and build software solutions
faster.**

## A Small Team

Netzo is composed of a team of committed, motivated and dynamic professionals
with a unique vision to interconnect the world through open web technology. We
are passionate about developing, expanding and maintaining **Netzo** which
consolidates hardware and software systems to a single place to deliver a fast
return of investment to our customers.

## A Grand Mission

Ever since the early days, our vision has remained one: simplify IT and
IoT-driven automation for anyone. From that moment forward, we’ve stumbled with
many people that share the enthusiasm, and others who think we are overly
ambitious. Many have recommended we first start on a specific market segment or
vertical. While we see how that makes the vision easier to think about, we are
sure that the true value is in the abstraction: a single platform to help you
interconnect any**Thing** in any way you want. And we’ve never considered
putting this dream aside.

We are convinced that the only real approach to true interoperability is through
an open platform. We are thus committed to building a community-driven, open web
platform to accelerate the digital transformation for anyone. We work hard to
empower people to build whatever they have in mind, and make it easier to share
that with others through an in-app Marketplace. A community-driven approach to
change the world will always win, and we are eager to deliver this with Netzo.

Ambitious ideals should be built on a stable basis. We are convinced that open
web standards are the technology that will enable true interoperability between
IT and OT domains where we need it most: the web. We thus embrace these
standards and augment them with additional features to make their adoption even
more powerful. We believe in simplicity, for which we deliver all this power
bundled into a single SaaS platform for you to worry less and do more. For this
we strive to fully support, promote and promulgate new web technologies into
real-world, production scenarios.

Our team is motivated by this vision and we strive first and foremost to share
its empowerment with the world. We look forward to getting to know people that
like us, believe in the power of technology to change the world. We are eager to
get to know what you build with Netzo.

Regards,

The Netzo founding team
