UI-based no-code/low-code tools have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way to automate workflows and build software solutions. They offer the promise of quickly creating working solutions with little or no coding required. However, they also have a number of significant drawbacks which can make them unsuitable for many purposes.

One of the biggest problems is that they lack the flexibility and customization options of traditional coding-based approaches. This can make them difficult or impossible to use for anything beyond simple use cases. As a result, they are more often than not unsuitable for automating complex or nuanced workflows. In addition, they can also be problematic when it comes to building software solutions to support team operations. This is because the lack of flexibility and customization can make it difficult to create tools that meet the specific needs of a team.

UI-based no-code/low-code tools can be a useful tool for automating workflows and building software solutions in some cases. However, it is important to be aware of their limitations in order to avoid using them for purposes for which they are not well suited. Before deciding to use a UI-based platform it is important to understand and decide whether or not the benefits outweigh some of the potential drawbacks we will discuss here.

## Lack of Flexibility and Customization

When first implementing a UI-based no-code/low-code platform, the convenience of not requiring developers for simple use cases may seem like a dream. These platforms usually include a drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy for non-technicals and business users to use them, and they often come with a library of pre-built components that can be easily installed with just a few clicks. In most cases, these platforms can be used to automate trivial tasks such as data entry and form submissions or create software solutions such as KPI dashboards or simple ticketing systems.

However, non-technicals can't just "drag and drop" their way to complex applications. Much like how you wouldn't expect to build a house by yourself with no experience, you can't expect to build a non-trivial application without some programming knowledge. Sure, you could get lucky, and put something together that works well enough...but it'll be a flimsy house that's prone to falling apart at the first hint of trouble. So when your business outgrows the capabilities of these platforms or you want to exploit their benefits, don't be surprised if you need to bring in some professional help from consultants or developers.

## Developers are Necessary

In today's businesses, developers play a vital role in delivering unique solutions that address complex use-cases. However, they often find themselves struggling with clumsy UI-based platforms that make it difficult to get the job done. Many developers find themselves spending more time coding around inflexible platforms than they would if they were coding the solution from scratch.

Developers like to code. It is what they do. They are not toolsmiths, nor are they Machinists. Developers write code. So when they are forced to spend time becoming proficient with the intricacies of tools with proprietary and disparate visual building components they may get easily frustrated.

The life of a developer is spent in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), crafting beautiful solutions to difficult problems. Developers zen out when their fingers flow across the keyboard, typing out lines of code that will make the application work. This is where they are in their element and when they are most productive. When a developer is forced to step away from the keyboard and interact with a tool that doesn't feel natural to them, it can be frustrating and counter-productive.

## Benefits of a Code-centric Approach

Code-centric platforms let developers code and do what they do best - assist in the process. Developers will be happier and more productive if they are able to stay in their zone and focus on what they do best - writing code. This is why it is so important for developers to have access to flexible, developer-friendly platforms that allow them to code without restrictions.

With Netzo you have the flexibility you need to create exactly what you want, without sacrificing functionality, performance or spending time provisioning or managing the infrastructure. Connect essential APIs together, build smarter data pipelines, automate unique business processes, build custom dashboards and UIsâ€¦ whatever you can code, you can do with Netzo.
