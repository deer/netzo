**[Netzo](https://app.netzo.io) is a development platform to code and deploy custom internal tools in vanilla JS/TS, with your favorite SSR frameworks and libraries and without managing infrastructure.**

## What is Netzo?

In a nutshell Netzo features a:

🧑🏽‍💻 A full-blown IDE with a built-in suite of developer tools<br/>
 ⚡ Instant serverless edge deployment<br/>
⏩ Buildless, auto-scalable infrastructure<br/>
👥 Collaboration and sharing features<br/>

**Netzo shines whenever a full development environment and managing infrastructure are overkill.**

By leveraging the power of serverless compute, Netzo allows you to build and deploy custom internal tools in minutes, liberating developers from infrastructure headaches and the DevOps burden to focus solely on value-adding solutions, leading to increased efficiency, productivity and scalability for organizations.

## What are software solutions?

**Software solutions** are software solutions that support the day-to-day operations of a business, such as dashboards, reports, and data processing pipelines. Software solutions are not specific to any particular industry, but are used by companies of all sizes and across all industries to streamline their operations. In general terms,

 🧩 API Integrations<br/>
 🤖 Workflow Automation and ETL flows<br/>
 🏗️ Custom Internal Apps<br/>
 📊 Dashboards and Reports<br/>
 📈 Data Processing Pipelines<br/>

are considered software solutions, as they are mainly used internally for the operational benefit of the company.

## How can we help?

 🎯 It is our goal to empower developers to create tailored solutions faster and share them within their teams and organization.
