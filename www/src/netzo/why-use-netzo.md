## The problem

**Operational inefficiency is a significant challenge for businesses, resulting in a loss of revenue and hindering their growth potential.** Inefficient internal processes can ultimately lead to the demise of companies. Software solutions serve as the heartbeat of successful operations, but traditional development methods and alternative solutions come with their own set of drawbacks, limiting productivity, flexibility, and adaptability.

## Netzo vs other tools

Alternative solutions for building software solutions can be costly, restrictive, and lead to increased resource expenditure in the long run. As a result, many companies are turning to in-house development to gain more control over their software solutions. However, in-house development is often time-consuming and demands significant resources, necessitating highly skilled teams. **Netzo presents a viable middle ground, offering the optimal balance between ease of use and full-code control**

### Building from scratch

In-house development offers complete flexibility but requires highly skilled teams. **Building tools from scratch is usually excessive for internal needs.**

### No-code/ low-code platforms

These alternatives prioritize convenience and ease of use for non-technical users but compromise flexibility, control, customization, extensibility, and adaptability. They impose limitations on scaling and require people and processes to conform to their constraints.
