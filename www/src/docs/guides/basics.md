# Basics

The following basic examples demonstrate the most basic approach to certain use cases. They are intended to be used to teach the fundamentals of how the Netzo runtime (powered by Deno) works, before diving into more advanced examples. Some examples are taken directly from the [Deno Deploy documentation](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/guides) and provided here for convenience, since Netzo is fully compatible with Deno Deploy.

::: tip Examples are all written in `TypeScript`/`TSX` but can written in `JavaScript`/`JSX` as well.

::: warning Running Examples
Some examples may require additional configuration to run. The `CLI` and `Netzo` tags are used to indicate which runtimes the example can be run with (if any) without further configuration.
