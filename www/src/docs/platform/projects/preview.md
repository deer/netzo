# Preview

**A live preview of your project can be accessed by clicking on Preview within Netzo.** The preview will open in a new tab and make an HTTP `GET` request to the project's URL. To test with other HTTP methods such as `POST` you could use the testing drawer in Netzo or an HTTP client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) or [`curl`](https://curl.se/). Note that these requests will count towards the request quota.
