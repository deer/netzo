# Deployments

**Deployments are the result of a successful execution of a Deployment in the Workspace.** Note that invoking a Deployment will not necessarily result in a new execution (e.g. unauthenticated HTTP request to private deployment). This attempts will however count towards the Requests quota of the Workspace.
