# Home

**The home page lists all projects shared with you from all Workspaces you are a member of.** Having access to all projects in one place makes it easy to find and access them and is an easy way for developers to publish and share what they build with their teams. Clicking on a project will take you its preview page and you will be able to access it without providing an API key despite it being set to `private`. To edit a project you will need to access the project edit page inside the Workspace it belongs to.
