# Templates

**Templates are ready-made, open source project starters for anyone to fork and get started quickly.** You can find starters for popular frameworks/libraries and common use cases in [app.netzo.io/templates](https://app.netzo.io/templates) where you can also fork them into your Workspaces. We encouraged developers to contribute to the community by sharing their development.

## Forking

You can fork items into any of your Workspaces provided they have sufficient usage limits. When you fork items, a copy is created so you can go ahead and make changes. Forked items will count normally for your Workspace usage.

## Contributing

You can contribute items directly in the [open source GitHub repository](https://github.com/netzo/netzo). To learn more about how to contribute, check-out the [`README`](https://github.com/netzo/netzo/tree/main/packages#readme) file in the repository.
