# Users

**Users are members of a Workspace with a user account and a pre-defined role.** Roles are how Netzo determines what a user can and cannot do within a Workspace. The following roles are available:

- `admin`
- `edit`
- `view`

You can navigate to the [User Settings](https://app.netzo.io/settings) page to manage your user account.

## General

![Settings general](/docs/images/users/users-settings-general.webp)

Displays general account information like

- user ID,
- display name

and user preferences like

- enable/disable dark theme,
- **privacy settings**: allow or deny 3rd party tools (e.g. in-app support chat and analytics)

## Workspaces

![Settings workspaces](/docs/images/users/users-settings-workspaces.webp)

Lists all Workspaces you belong to and the role you have in the Workspace (e.g. `admin`, `edit`, `view`). If you are not the sole Workspace `admin`, you can choose to leave a Workspace, loosing access to all its resources.

## Delete user

![Settings delete user](/docs/images/users/users-settings-delete-user.webp)

Here you can delete you user account permanently. This will have permanent consequences depending on your role in the Workspace:

- **If you are the sole Workspace `admin`**, the Workspace (including all its contained resources) will be deleted as well.
- **If you are either not the only `admin` or not an `admin` at all**, you will simply be removed from it, loosing access to all its resources.

::: danger Closing your user account is permanent and cannot be undone.
