# Fair Use Policy

Netzo uses Deno infrastructure internally and its usage is thus restricted to that of Deno. The following is taken directly from the Deno [fair use policy](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/fair-use-policy) and provided here for convenience:

## Examples of Fair Use

- ✅ Server-side rendered websites
- ✅ Jamstack sites and apps
- ✅ Single page applications
- ✅ APIs that query a DB or external API
- ✅ A personal blog
- ✅ A company website
- ✅ An e-commerce site

## Not Fair Use

- ❌ Crypto mining
- ❌ Highly CPU-intensive load (e.g. machine learning)
- ❌ Media hosting for external sites
- ❌ Scrapers
- ❌ Proxy or VPN

## Guidelines

We expect most projects to fall well within the usage limits. We will notify you if your projects usage significantly deviates from the norm. We will reach out to you where possible before taking any action to address unreasonable burdens on our infrastructure.
